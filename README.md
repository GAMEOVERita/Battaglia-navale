# Battaglia-navale
battaglia navale (battleship if you speak english) is a tabletop game played by two players who take turns to fight each other and win, to win a player must wipe out all the ships in the enemy field, we are trying to recreate this simple game in java to better learn and understand java outside school settings
the code is written half in italian and english and we are slowly porting it to english to make it more accessible to everyone
STILL WIP -- the code is still being worked on and the game is not functional, if you have any constructive criticism we will be happy to hear it :)
